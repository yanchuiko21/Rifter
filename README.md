# Rifter
This is my second university project where I was learning new programming language namely Java.

# What is this programme?
This is game in which user register an account and go to play quiz game in which he earns currency called "VRC". User can go to shop and buy differents items there. Also, user can check go to profile option where he can see account details with inventory. The programme brings an exciting and entertaining experience for the user through the game in which he not only earns currency but also improves his knowledge of the local history and culture(in our case Cambridge). With the help of the store, they can spend their VRC on useful items, which is great for Cambridge residents and students. Also, I canâ€™t leave the leaderboard aside, which also helps the programme to give an exciting and interesting experience to the user, since he is constantly competing with other users who play this game, too. Users will play the game more and more, learning the local history and local culture and trying to break into the first places leaderboard.
